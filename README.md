This project implements a simple substitution cipher where each English letter is replaced by a unique symbol. It includes two functions:  encode_message() → Converts plain text into encoded symbols.  decode_message() → Converts encoded symbols back into readable text.  It’s a fun way to practice cryptography basics and Python dictionary lookups.
